# eNodeB Configuration
## Prerequisites

Make sure you follow the instructions in "[Deploying Orchestrator](
https://facebookincubator.github.io/magma/docs/orc8r/deploying)" for successful
installation of Orchestrator and the instructions in "[AGW Configuration](
https://facebookincubator.github.io/magma/docs/lte/config_agw)" to provision and
configure your Access Gateway (AGW).

You should be able to access the orchestrator REST API and validate successful
periodic check-in(s) between the AGW and Orchestrator.

## S1 interface
Connect your eNodeB to the `eth1` interface of Magma gateway. Magma uses `eth1`
as the default `S1` interface. If you have more than one eNodeB, use an L2
switch to connect all `S1` interfaces.

## Automatic configuration
*Magma officially supports auto-configuration of the following devices:*
* Baicells Nova-243 Outdoor FDD/TDD eNodeB
  - Firmware Version: BaiBS_RTS_3.1.6
* Baicells mBS1100 LTE-TDD Base Station
  - Firmware Version: BaiStation_V100R001C00B110SPC003

*Magma supports the following management protocols:*
* TR-069 (CWMP)

*Magma supports configuration of the following data models:*
* TR-196 data model
* TR-181 data model

The Magma team plans to add support for more devices and management protocols.

To handle automatic configuration of eNodeB devices on your network, Magma
uses the `enodebd` service. The `enodebd` service is responsible for handling
the O&M interface between Magma and any connected eNodeB. The `enodebd` service
can be disabled if you configure your eNodeB devices manually.

### Baicells
*1. Set eNodeB management server URL to `baiomc.cloudapp.net:48080`*

Magma uses DNS hijacking to point the eNodeB to the configuration server
being run by enodebd. `baiomc.cloudapp.net:48080` will point to
`192.88.99.142`, the IP address that the configuration server is being hosted
on.

*2. Create eNodeB configurations on the NMS*

In the network management system, you'll want to create a new eNodeB
configuration for each one you are using in your network. You'll need to
double-check that you have the correct serial ID inputted for each eNodeB,
otherwise the AGW auto-configuration of connected eNodeB devices will not work.

After creating your eNodeB configurations, you'll want to go back and edit
your AGW settings on NMS. Under the LTE tab of your AGW settings, enter in
the serial IDs of the eNodeB devices that you are connecting to your AGW. Only
registered eNB devices will be configured by the AGW.

After you have finished your configurations on NMS, network configuration
settings are propagated to the AGW. This should take about a minute if your
AGW is actively checking-in to your orchestrator. You can also double check
by viewing `/var/opt/magma/gateway.mconfig` in your AGW, which should be
updated when configuration updates are streamed from the orchestrator.

### Basic Troubleshooting
After connecting your eNodeB(s) to the gateway through the `eth1` interface, you
may want to check a few things if auto-configuration is not working.

Magma will be running a DHCP server to assign an IP address to your connected
eNodeB. Check if an IP address gets assigned to your eNodeB by either checking
the eNodeB UI or monitoring the `dnsd` service.

```
journalctl -u magma@dnsd -f
# Check for a similar log
# DHCPDISCOVER(eth1) 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPOFFER(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPREQUEST(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPACK(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
```

Use the `enodebd_cli.py` tool to check basic status of eNodeB(s). It also allows
for querying the value of parameters, setting them, and sending reboot requests
to the eNodeB. The following example gets the status of all connected eNodeBs.

```
enodebd_cli.py get_all_status
# --- eNodeB Serial: 120200002618AGP0001 ---
# IP Address..................10.0.2.246
# eNodeB connected.....................1
# eNodeB Configured....................1
# Opstate Enabled......................1
# RF TX on.............................1
# RF TX desired........................1
# GPS Connected........................0
# PTP Connected........................0
# MME Connected........................1
# GPS Longitude...............113.902069
# GPS Latitude.................22.932018
# FSM State...............Completed provisioning eNB. Awaiting new Inform.
```

It may take time for the eNodeB to start transmitting because `enodebd` will
reboot the eNodeB to apply new configurations. Monitor the progress of `enodebd`
using the following command

```
journalctl -u magma@enodebd -f
# Check for a similar log
# INFO:root:Successfully configured CPE parameters!
```

## Manual configuration
Manual configuration of connected eNodeB(s) is always possible. Magma was tested
with multiple Airspan eNodeB models configured through NetSpan management
software.
When manually configuring eNodeBs, make sure the eNodeB configuration matches
that of the Magma cellular configuration. Pay special attention to the
configuration of `PLMN`, `EARFCN` and `TAC`.

### Basic Troubleshooting
When manually configuring your eNodeB, you can use the manufacturers tools or
interfaces to monitor and troubleshoot the eNodeB configuration.

You can also listen to the `S1` interface traffic and validate a proper `S1`
setup and handshake. Below are the `SCTP` packets exchanged between the eNodeB
and MME.

```

### Adding subscribers
Once your eNodeB starts transmitting, UEs may attempt to attach to your network.
Network will reject these attach requests due to authentication failure. To add
a subscriber to the subscriber database, we can use the swagger API again.
Navigate to `/lte/{network_id}/subscribers` and use the provided sample
json to add a subscriber to the network.

```
{
  "id": "IMSI001010000000083",
  "lte": {
    "auth_algo": "MILENAGE",
    "auth_key": "i69HPy+P0JSHzMvXCXxoYg==",
    "auth_opc": "",
    "state": "ACTIVE"
  }
}
```

Note that the ID field is the letters “IMSI” followed by the 15 digit IMSI
(e.g. “IMSI123456789012345”)
. `auth_key` and `auth_opc` are both base 64-encoded binaries. HEX to base64
conversion can be done using this [online tool](
https://cryptii.com/pipes/hex-to-base64).

Subscriber information will eventually propagate to the AGW. You can verify
using the CLI command `"subscriber_cli.py list"`

### Validating UE connectivity
Validating UE connectivity can be done from the UE side, MME side, or by
listening to traffic on the `S1` interface.
Below is a typical UE attach procedure as captured on the `S1` interface.
