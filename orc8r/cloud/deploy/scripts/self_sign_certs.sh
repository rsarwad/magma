# self_sign_certs.sh generates a set of keys and self-signed certificates.
#
# Generated secrets
#   - rootCA.key, rootCA.pem -- certs for trusted root CA (rootCA.key is
#     subsequently deleted)
#   - controller.key, controller.crt -- certs for orc8r deployment's public
#     domain name, signed by rootCA.key
#
# NOTE: extension naming for certs and keys is non-normalized here due to
# expected naming conventions from other parts of the code. For reference,
# all outputs are PEM-encoded, *.key is a private key, and *.crt and missing
# indicator are both certificates.
