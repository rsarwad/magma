# This is an optional script which can be used instead of build. it launches a
# shell into the devmand builder where the user can run commands such as:
#   make
#   /cache/devmand/build/devmand
#   gdb /cache/devmand/build/devmand
#   /cache/devmand/build/devmantest
# You can edit files in your favorite editor outside the container as they are
# ro mounted into the container. Just build and running must be done inside the
# shell. This does not launch devmand with the magma infrastructure and thus
# this does not connect to the cloud.
