This screen shows all the work orders that are assigned to the logged in user (technician).
Entering a work order allows to view its information like properties, dates, attachments etc.

But most importantly it allows the technician to view and answer its **Checklist**.
Checklist items are divided into categories.

Once responses are filled, the technician is able to upload the data, which will be shown in the Work Orders website.
